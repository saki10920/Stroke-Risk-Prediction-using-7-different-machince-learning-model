Stroke Prediction with Green AI

This project implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a stroke. Alongside model performance, the project also tracks and analyzes CO‚ÇÇ emissions during training using the CodeCarbon
library, highlighting the importance of sustainable AI.
